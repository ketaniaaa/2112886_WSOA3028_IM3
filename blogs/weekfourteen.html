<p>Recently I discovered a website on which you can test your implicit bias regarding various topics. Given my previous article, regarding the implicit racism within the tech industry, I thought that elaborating on the extent of our bias in different areas of our lives effect the digital content that we create. </p>
<p>To be honest, taking the test was hard to do at first. Taking the implicit bias test can make you conscious of some of your biases because you are forced to think about your stance on certain topics. The outcomes that I received when doing a country implicit bias test and weight bias test were that I preferred South Africa to America and BIPOC to other groups. </p>
<p>What I realized from this test was that I tend to prioritize groups of people that I am apart of and understand better. I am South African and Indian and therefore chose with the groups that I fall into. This surprised me as I thought that my results would indicate that I had a preference for a developed country such as America and due to the lack of diverse representation, I would have a clear racial bias towards privileged communities. This made me realize that as humans, we tend to prefer groups that we feel more belonging. I think that this is a result of fundamentally wanting inclusion and our innate disdain for the “other”. Personally, I feel that I prefer these groups because those would similar experiences are less likely to understand me but this is something we all as individuals must investigate. </p>
<p>These can have a direct effect on the content that we create. I believe this is because implicit bias can blind one from seeing past their own needs. Elsbach and Stigliani found in their research that there is a tendency to create agendas based on our individual understanding. This shows it is likely that the content that we create is best suited for ourselves or the groups that we align with. The implications of creating digital spaces from a limited point-of-view results in an exclusionary web experience. The web aims to support a large population and therefore it is necessary to ensure that the technology that is created is accessible. In order to derail heightening the digital inequality, aside from hardware issues, it is vital that creators in the tech industry adhere to ethical practices. </p>
<p>An interesting development aiming to alleviate this issue of implicit bias is the engineering of AI that is implicit. According to Huang et. al (2020), this technology can be used as a method to guide design and development processes in the tech space. I think that this might be a naïve solution because who is creating the AI that supposedly regulates bias technology? Is the creator not biased themselves? Of course they are! As humans, it is impossible to avoid bias entirely as bias is a result of our environments and development, often aspects that we do not have control over. I believe that creating AI that completely eradicates the large issue of implicit bias will be a long journey or research and collaboration. Collaboration of creators from different environments and views. This collaboration and regulation in itself can allow for better unbiased tech. </p>
<p>Creators cannot rely on their own experiences as we are each only exposed to a limited experience of the vast world. Let us not create equally limited technology. As always the first step to creating a better technological environment is educating oneself regarding their own implicit biases and why these biases have been raised.</p>
