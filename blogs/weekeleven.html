</section>
<p>I believe that I am I visual person and so my design decisions have previously been led by what I believe is visually appealing. Throughout this course, I have been exposed to User Experience and User Interface practices on a large scale and this has transformed the way I look at the websites that I interact with, but also how I approach design decisions.</p>
<p>The basis of UX and UI is to allow for a streamline experience. The use of convention is something I adhered to when creating my site. This was done because this course was my first experience creating a website and I wanted to know the rules before I broke the rules. I tried to take the advice I saw in the plethora of <i>Medium</i> and <i>Google Scholar</i> articles I read with little deviation.</p>
<p>There were a few key experiences that I wanted to communicate through my design. I wanted by website to be minimal yet trendy. It has been noted that western users prefer open space in the websites, and this resulted in my aim for a minimalist appearance. When users are presented with an overload of visual stimuli, they are less likely to engage with the content and therefore tend to find sites less useable. This, of course, is not an absolute truth yet I do believe that open spaced design is the fundament of how websites have been designed for the past decade.  This meant that my users, who are English speakers and therefore are exposed to the western conventions of web design, would find open space more pleasing. This led me to creating a website that focused on spaced out content with white space to allow for my user to breathe. The reason behind wanting to communicate the feeling of open space was to better represent the calming nature of my character. </p>
<p>The use of space and design trends lead me to discovering Brutalism. The movement has been inspired by the principles of the architectural movement Brutalism. Upon research into the movement, it was noted that importance is placed on a simple structure that allows for simplicity and focus on the raw materials. This was the experience that I wanted to create for my user, a visit to a sense of ‘pure’ internet. This meant avoiding elaborate background and container styling. I deliberately chose to make harsh borders and use a font that resembles scripting fonts to communicate a sense of nostalgic early internet, while still allowing the user to feel that the design of the website is not outdated. Cora is only 23 and her clients are usually millennials and gen-z’s, meaning that most of the users likely to visit her site are more accustomed to the web design practices of the 2010’s. I also took into consideration the reason why they would visit her site. Cora is mainly a psychic and a blogger. This meant that users would visit the site either to get a booking with Cora or to share in her wisdom. This is why I have made the navigation minimal in order to focus mainly on the blog and the shop. The shop redirects users to other apps as the main function that I wanted for my sight was Cora to share her spiritual wisdom with the internet and document her experience as a necromancer.</p>
<p>Another key factor that I began to consider was the usability of the site for mobile users. This led me to including code that allowed for resizing and accommodation for other screen sizes. The first step towards responsivity was including a burger menu on collapse. I do believe that this menu is not as usable as I would like for mobile users. </p>
<p> I believe that I was able to communicate my intentions but I could have used more white space in my blog home pages. This feels overwhelming to me and therefore goes against the designed experience I wanted to convey. I also used images instead of text which would have been more accessible to more users. There are instances of divs being used for aesthetic purposes. Upon improvement of my site, I would pay better attention to the mark-up I use for better experiences of users. </p>
<p>There are many improvements and decisions I would like to further detail apart from my main choices that I have discussed but alas, there are constraints, and you will have to wait until next time. </p>
