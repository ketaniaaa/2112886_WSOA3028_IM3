<p>Often times design is reduced to creating a visual aesthetic, but design is a practice that is deeply rooted in our society. As a creator the creative practice of design is often dismissed as a frivolous and unnecessary sect of the world, but this is due to the miseducation regarding how crucial design is to human lives. This week, we look at Victor Papanek’s interpretation of design and its role in our lives. Papanek indicates that design is an age-old practice that is imbedded in human nature. Every object that we interact with in our lives has been design. Design refers to the organization of information regarding information that makes these said objects more usable. The fundament of design is organization. Organization allows for us to understand how an object can be best used in our lives. </p>
<p>Design requires both conscious and instinctive practice to create meaningful organization. The result of this organization is both functionality and aesthetics. Papanek admits that situating the idea of instinct in design is difficult to define but alludes to paying attention to human patterns to better understand instinct. An example of this may be what we <i> feel</i> looks and feels good to use or what catches our eye. This can be seen as instinct, and this instinct can therefore be included in the design process. These instincts that feel good to humans can be seen through the design principles that exist. For example, a key principle of design is contrast. This is a principle of design because contrast allows an emphasis point for users. When one’s action is captured, they are more likely to engage with the focal point and therefore gives function to this element. This demonstrates how human instinct, through analysis of what appeals to us, can lead to functionality. Instinct also allows designers to create products that feel more natural to users. This is important as the introduction to new devices in hard to do when something feels unfamiliar to a user. This means that conventions that feel right must be taken into consideration when designing. </p>
<p>Papanek goes on to say that design is ultimately the practice of problem-solving needs and this should drive the design process. This means that items need to be designed with the end goals of good workability and good looks in mind. The fact that design places importance on both aesthetics and functionality raises the notion that aesthetic is a highly intellectual process. As mentioned earlier, the visual look of an item has a direct impact on how someone will make use of the object. The visual aspects of an object allows one to imbed visual cues that lead to functionality to exist. </p>
<p>This clearly can be translated into the web. As the internet is relatively knew, the shift to making use of digital devices on a daily basis has been design with the intention of easy use and automation. This can be seen in how designers attempt to create interfaces that replicate in real-life actions into digital spaces. The inclusion of actions that replicate real life is done for a better feel and can be seen through the mobile action of changing the colour of a button on hover to replicate the process of a button being pushed in which can be experienced in real-life. In order for information to be processes, the form in which the information is presented and the content itself must be design to ensure that the product is well received by users. Papanek’s insights into the impact that design has on its environment can help designers to better integrate different societies to new spaces, such as the web. Design can allow for more inclusive objects.  </p>
