<p>During the age of the ‘web 2.0’, the surge of a new type of content creation called user generated content or ‘UGC’ has infiltrated our feeds. While this new form of content creation may seem revolutionary, there is a sinister underbelly to UGC.  </p>

<p>UGC means that internet users are also active in creating the content that they desire for the consumption of fellow internet users. This has allowed the internet to become a collaborative space in which users are able to contribute content. This can be seen through social media that may be the likes of this very blog, entertainment such as Youtube and information sharing as seen via Wikipedia.  </p>

<p>While this has been seen as a positive, allowing a free-flow of easily accessible content from a larger range of creators than ever before, user generated content may be leading to more evil. Theodore Nelson predicted a few of the main problems that plague the topic of UGC currently in his 1981 paper, “Proposal for a Universal Electronic Publishing System and archive from Literary Machines”.
The first being public access. The creation of the web and browsers such as google has allowed easy public access to various areas of the internet.  Free access allows for the spread of misinformation. It has become more common to depend on live feeds of social media in order to stay informed on current events. This means users have become more reliant on user generated content for facts. The downside to this is that incorrect information is quickly spread. Alongside misinformation, UGC allows for more freedom of press and negatives such as hate speech or bias are more likely to be voiced. With the volume of UGC, it would be impossible to regulate content and therefore the responsibility to verify content should be placed onto individuals. This open access leads to the next issue: Internet legality. </p>

<p>The legal system is full of grey areas concerning the internet that allow the creation of content that may be seen as morally wrong by users with little to no repercussion. Copyright infringement and misuse of intellectual property is more likely to occur with UGC. Again, due to the volume, it would be impossible to monitor that good internet practice surrounds all user-generated content. These legal grey areas are coupled with piracy becoming a more accepted practice online. Alas, there is one positive, it is becoming more apparent that users have the upper hand in dictating new copyright laws due to the influence of UGC. </p>

<p>Unethical internet practice around user generated content leads me to the final problem with this type of content creation - the exploitation of prosumers. Prosumer refers to an individual who both creates and consumes the content they create. In this sense, UGC is made by prosumers. UGC is estimated to be generated 4-5 times more than professional web content daily basis. Many view this as revolutionary as now the audience is in control of content yet this can lead to free labour and devaluation of creation. Due to the popularity of UGC, professional organizations are less likely to invest in professional content. This means that online forms of creation lose value. This also fuels capitalism because now, not only are people buying into new content but are forced to generate the content themselves, ultimately resulting in doubled capitalist behavior. Was the aim of the internet not to lessen our workload?  </p>

<p>While I love consuming content from people just like me, a deeper look into user generated content has made me question my support of this open plethora of user contributions. I am possibly joined by you, my reader with the dilemma of how to navigate this large area of the web with this new lens. Possibly the only solution to continue enjoying UGC is to ensure that individually we all practice good internet etiquette and protect ourselves to our best ability. </p>
