<p>Writing my 3rd novel “Cyber Blind” required me to do a lot of research about how the internet is designed to keep users coming back. This led me down the road of usability and accessibility on the web.</p>
<p>
(Now don’t worry, I won’t spoil too much of Cyber Blind if you haven’t read it, but I am going to be discussing tiny sliver of the technology that the novel centres around. </p><p>
P.S If you want to see a world where our dependence on the net gets too high, here’s a link to get your hands on a copy.) </p><p>
Usability is based on making sure you’re checking all the boxes of your user. This has given way to the development of user-centric design. You only need to look at the new career fields like UI and UX design to understand why everyone is trying to make sure their users are driving the content that they are consuming.  I mean, we all want to feel in control, don’t we? </p><p>
This control that is the focus behind web design became the basis for the virtual world that holds the characters in Cyber Blind hostage. The web in the novel becomes so customizable, that the users can’t help but become absorbed into their curated cyber paradise. Experiencing life through new technology becomes necessary and only few spend enough time away from their screens to see that their reality is crumbling. </p><p>
Yes, I know that my novel is a tad hyperbolic but if you understand the reasoning behind usability, you know that we are already being conditioned to automate so much of our lives through the internet as incentive to look at our screens for longer. Usability relies on translating experiences and actions that users are already familiar with in the material world onto digital platforms. This can be seen with the modular layout of websites that reflect the way that newspapers have been formatted for centuries. This enables users to be able to navigate websites easily because they are used to the way information is presented. The easier one can use their technology, the more time they can save getting their goal for using the web achieved. This might seem counterproductive, but according to ______, this timesaving has conditioned internet user’s satiation for the extremely addictive instant gratification. </p><p>
This visual layout is great for helping seeing users with usability but is disadvantageous to the visually impaired. When designing content, the goal is to be as inclusive as possible as to attract a larger audience. This is why analysing users wants and needs is crucial. Brown raises the idea of user rationality is what we should use as a starting point. This refers to the choice that users make based on their preferences and needs. This is reflected in the popularization of light and dark mode which is making designing two schemes an industry standard. This way of designing content is intrinsically more inclusive because designers are forced to implement design decisions that accommodate all their users needs. This can be seen in the solution to the modular layout by writing semantically correct code that can be understood by screen readers. </p><p>
Speaking of code, I am sure that you know code is basically another language and understanding tech from a linguistic point-of-view made writing all my cyber centric worlds a whole lot easier for this English degree holder. Semiotic usability is a way of creating inclusive designs by adopting the idea of semiotic narrative into digital spaces. </p><p>
For those of you that don’t know, semiotics refers to the study of signs. Signs act as concepts that a repeated in order to become easily recognized and understood. Designers are able to therefore confirm that they are imparting meaning in every detail of the design process, but also ensures that users are able to navigate digital spaces with no friction. The 6 aspects of the semiotic structure being subject, object, receiver, sender, helper and opponent have become synonymous with the term’s active user, personal aim, passive consumer, product, usability and disadvantage of use respectively for content design. This model allows developers and designers better facilitate their users’ online goals. </p><p>
Inspiration can come from understanding our world. A lot of my writing is derived from forcing myself to understand the internet more and learning the secrets of the people that give us the web will surprise you. Hopefully you are more interested in our the web is made for us so you can also become a creator, as an extension. </p>
