</section>
<p>This week we are discussing the new opportunities regarding machine learning. I am going to discuss the ethics of the software that create by looking at Wu and Zhang’s 2016 research regarding machine learning software to predict the likelihood of a person being a criminal based off their facial features. </p>
<p>Firstly, what is machine learning? The notion of machine learning can seem like a huge and complicated concept but really what it is, is giving software pieces of information in order for it to create a pattern which will finally result in a solution. An easier way to think of machine learning is think of that high school math that I am sure we all wanted to forget. Take an equation such as 5+3=x, machine learning is basically creating software to find x. </p>
<p>Now that we understand what machine learning is, we can understand how Wu and Zhang try to justify their software. Their proposed approach to create algorithms to predict the likelihood of faces that that are of criminals consisted of analysing the headshots of convicted felons. This was based of Lombroso’s ideas related to criminology, in which he theorized that ones facial structure can allude to their moral standing. It is important that there was no empirical scientific basis on which this theory was validated by. Lombroso’s theory was found to make use of many racial stereotypes. This means that Wu and Zhang’s basis for their algorithm was already quite questionable. </p>
<p>Wu and Xu claim that their algorithm bypasses the human bias that can judge people as criminals as their software boasted 90% accuracy. Can the software really be unbiased if the humans creating it cannot help but be biased? Wu and Zhang seem to have avoided the racial stereotypes of Lombroso’s theory by using a sample group of only Chinese men. They ensure that these men had no distinguishable features and then created an algorithm based off the shared facial traits of offenders from the entire sample of headshots. Wu and Zhang claim that their machine learning software allows for no bias, but it must be noted that these pictures of criminals were chosen. In choosing the headshots to create the algorithm, the samples were imbedded with bias.  It is also clear that the photos of criminals are of convicted criminals, which the researchers claim have been provided by police departments. This means that these headshots were created when criminals were arrested and charged and therefore their software cannot account for non-convicted criminals. This is further supported by the supposed findings that the algorithm tends to categorize men that are not smiling as criminals. Does this mean that if someone is not happy, they are a criminal? </p>
<p>It is clear that Wu and Zhang have not created a golden piece of machine learning that can alleviate centuries of bias. Their research demonstrates that it is extremely difficult to create unbiased software when, we are humans, are fundamentally biased. In order to really achieve accurate data, the algorithm must be provided with a wide variety of headshots, that spans race, age and gender, but must also account for criminals that haven’t been convicted already. This seems to be a big task to carry out but in order to create ethical software, precautions must be made that our implicit bias does not become enmeshed with the software that we develop. </p>
<p>The criminal justice system demands the upmost ethical practice and depending on machine learning with a lack of empirical evidence seems counter intuitive. This software also does not allow for the process of investigation and human interaction with suspects to be abolished so this makes one question, is there a purpose for Wu and Zhang’s algorithm if it causes more work than automation? I don’t know about you, but personally, I am not ready to live in an Orwellian world where scans of my facial features determine my status as a criminal. </p>
