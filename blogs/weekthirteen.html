<p>Podcasts provide a great platform to learn more about the latest conversations happening in the tech industry and the Radical AI podcast has some amazing discussions happening. Last week, we discussed the ethical consequences regarding the technology that we create and this week I look at the ethics of the tech industry from a racial point of view. When creating services of products made for societies, there needs to be ethical guidance in place. .</p>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7BbuHqG23ZjwEhG7a6iSAl?si=qxWSZ35HQMiSBCUt9zN4-Q&dl_branch=1">The Radical AI podcast </a>discusses the implications of racism on the technology that is created with the sociologist, Dr Ruha Benjamin. Benjamin is well known for her writing on the racial impact on technology. This is important to discuss because racial bias is intertwined with the manner in which we create programs and software. In order to solve the racial inequality, we need to understand the unconscious nuances that allow for this inequality to exist. .</p>
<p>Dr Benjamin highlights the impact of history and society on the tech industry. As we still feel the effects of racialized histories, it is unavoidable that this historic impact would not bleed into the tech industry. The way she was led to the basis of her book, <q> Race after Technology </q>, was the questions she had regarding the power play that effects knowledge. If you read by article about the digital divide, you will recall that knowledge allows for power and communities that have better access to knowledge are sects of society that were historically privileged. In simple terms, the global north that dominates the global information system is largely white. This gives an indication that a lot of the technological products that we interact with have been largely designed to support these communities, with little consideration for marginalized communities. These marginalized communities usually refer to BIPOC people. .</p>
<p>Dr Benjamin raises the problem that the creators of tech create technology based off their experiences and needs and this causes a lack of inclusion for the needs of other communities. This means that creators or developers are not necessarily aware that they are creating digital spaces that are not accessible. Racism is not always a conscious action and therefore we need to educate ourselves regarding our implicit bias in order to avoid the consequences of this inherent discrimination. This is clear in the rise of the term <q> AI Discrimination </q>. AI discrimination refers to the idea that algorithms play into racial prejudices and contribute to the levels of inequality within the tech space. A recent example of this is the TikTok algorithm in which users have noticed that the algorithm tends to display videos with white creators to users at a much higher frequency than specifically black and other POC creators. This clearly demonstrates the integration of racial bias into the technology that we interact with. The result of such an algorithm of oppression results in even less representation of minority groups in mainstream media. .</p>
<p>In order to address this issue, Dr Benjamin emphasizes the need for people in the tech industry to be racially literate when creating software that will ultimately be used by society. Guidelines alone will not solve this issue. I believe it becomes the responsibility of a creator to take int consideration the digital limitations of users that are outside one’s own community. I, myself have been privileged enough to have been exposed to digital devices throughout my life but in order to create good digital content, I cannot focus on my own experiences. It is of utmost importance to realize that racism does not exist in isolation. In order to alleviate this problem, we need to research how best we can accommodate for racially marginalized in the tech industry. .</p>
<p>To end this weeks post, love and anger can be incredibly beneficial in getting closer to more equal digital spaces. Dr Ruha Benjamin is so passionate about rectifying these discriminatory practices because of the love that she feels for these marginalized groups and the anger that is a result of the inequality that is experienced by those that she loves. .</p>
