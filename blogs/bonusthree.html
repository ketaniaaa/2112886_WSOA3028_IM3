<p>Hypertext is something that you probably encounter daily, but what is hypertext? Wardrip-Fruin gives insight to what hypertext is and the relevance of hypertext to modern life. Ted Nelson first coined the term in the 1960’s and it is still a relevant term needed by web developers. Hypertext is a derivative of human created media content that has the goal of performing a task. Hypertext has a wide range of definitions but most often, it is referred to as a link between two groups of content. The term hypertext is a fundamental aspect of the internet. To contextualize this definition within the spectrum of technology, hypertext can refer to the relationship between information that can be associated. </p>
<p>Hypertext can be categorized as a new media and this term often becomes convoluted with hypermedia.   The internet is reliant on the ability to connect related information. The linking of pages creates the structure of the web and this is done by the non-linear connections of information that hypertext allows for.  Hypertext allows for a non-linear manner in order to allow the reader or user to choose how to follow the structure of the content by following certain links. This, in linguistics particularly, can allow a reader to achieve more personalized meaning making from content that is mediated by hypertext (Amaral). Often times, the manner in which information is so complexly interlinked, that hypertext offers a solution for users and readers to understand the challenging mass of information in a concise manner.  Hypermedia refers to the aspects of web pages that are not text based. This means images, sounds or any media of similar kinds. Often times, hypermedia respond to user’s interaction and are a supplement to hypertext. This means that hypertext is a multimodal concept. Wardrip-Fruin raises how crucial it is to understand that hypertext itself is not a product but is a theory. </p>
<p>Hypertext, while in isolation is conceptual, it has allowed for the creation of products, specifically in technology. An example of this is the creation of the markup language that is most often used to create webpages, HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. The basis of how we create structure for the web lends itself to hypertext. HTML allows web developers to create the structure of websites and embed documents with linking between various pages and markup allows for the annotation of content that the user will interact with. </p>
<p>In terms of HTML, which is the most popular use of hypertext on the web, hypertext refers to hyperlinks. Hyperlinking is what allows us to access different areas of the internet and the concept of the internet is fundamentally the linking of information from all over the world. Understanding what hypertext is means that one can better understand how the internet ultimately works. </p>
<p>This was a difficult concept to grasp. The existence of hypertext in both linguistic fields and technological fields can be extremely confusing but I do believe that understanding hypertext is a prerequisite for creating information that will ultimately end up on the internet. Developers must force themselves to realize that web structure does not need to be linear but the hyperlinking deployed can aid in giving structure. It must also be considered that hypertext gives both the developer and the user a variety of options. The developer is given a bigger scope on how to present content and allows the user to decide how they want to format their interaction of given content. </p>
