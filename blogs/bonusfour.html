<p>Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web design. The internet aims to support a wide range of users and with a large variety of users interacting with websites, their needs must be accounted for. This is a core focus of user interface and user experiences designers. This week I will be talking more about accessibility in regard to the design process. When designing a product made for the web, content must be make available and good design allows for this accommodation. </p>
<p>Accessibility can come in various manners when creating web products. The first consideration that a designer should make is that of hardware. The digital devices that are available to users vary in the presentation of information. This means that in order to make content accessible, it is necessary to ensure that web design is responsive and accounts for varied sizes of devices. Creating a product just for one form, such as desktop makes content inaccessible to mobile users. There has been an increased need for more responsive design as the digital culture has transformed to include more mobile users (Lazar, 2004). This is because mobile devices are often more available to users due to their compact design. This means in order to reach a large network of people; responsive web design ultimately impacts the accessibility of your digital content. </p>
<p>Often times, modular design is implemented in order to allow for better responsive design. This can result in inaccessible web design if not considered with caution(Crow and Francisco-Revilla, 2009). This is because modular layouts aim to cater for visual design. This helps users interpret information in an organized manner. This implementation of aesthetic value ultimately does not support visually impaired users. When designing for the web, visually impaired users must be considered. This means creating pages that are legible to screen readers. The legibility is dependant on markup. The need for good markup demonstrates that semantics must be prioritized instead of HTML that is used for styling purposes. In order to avoid bad markup which renders screen readers useless on a site is to make us of semantic markup. </p>
<p>Another way to support disable users and users of different digital proficiency is to ensure that the web experience is as seamless as possible. This may include design considerations for partially impaired users by implementing WGAC’s contrast ratios of 4:5:1 and ability to change text sizes for better visibility. A good manner to ensure accessibility is to prioritize function before appearance. The main goal of the web is to aid users end goals and therefore their ability to fulfil their tasks must be made a priority. </p>
<p>To conclude, as a designer, guidelines and regulations regarding the accessibility of design must be constantly referred to. With the internet allowing for more users to make use of digital content, it is vital that needs of users are prioritized and the web is made as impartial as possible by considering the needs of disabled users. Good implementation of accessibility allows for users to have abetter experience using products. This ulitmately means that accessibility allows for greater usability. </p>
