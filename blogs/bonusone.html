<p>A little while ago, I discussed the digital divide and the impact on South African society. If you haven’t read it yet, check it out <a href=>here</a> It was clear that the digital divide has an intensified impact on particularly African women, which is why this week I am going to discuss Magenya’s essay on creating a more inclusive internet space for the women of Africa. </p>
<p>With the recent pandemic that we are all living through, there is a new emphasis on online communication when in-real life interaction is limited due to social distancing. This ‘solution’ to the problem of Covid-19 has been to shift in person gathering to internet gathering but this is not an easy solution given the immense digital divide that we face on the continent of Africa. In order to shift to online learning, there is a prerequisite of being digitally literate and able to access digital hardware. This unfortunately, is not the case for many women. The rising dependence of more communities on the internet increases the need for internet spaces to accommodate groups of like BIPOC women. </p>
<p>It is well know that the global south, in particular, the continent of Africa contributes at a far lower rate to the global information system in comparison to other knowledge centres of the world. This inequality in information geography results in a lack of representation of the African continent, ultimate further isolating the content from partaking in global conversations. This raises the need for more African representation and Magenya raises the even greater need to display the stories of African <em> women</em>. The effects of colonial structures have affected the ways in which we interpret the internet. Magenya notes that these colonial structures that exist in real life aspects of society have been replicated on the web. In order to achieve an equal society, the internet must be considered. The entire goal of feminism is to achieve equality and there is a great deal of inequality regarding the internet currently. In order to rectify this, African voices must be given a platform. The manner in which African voices are presented is also important. Often times, technology is seen as a way to improve ones circumstances instead of a form of creativity. This view needs to change because this possess Africans as consumers of content rather than creators. Another issue regarding the representation of Africa comes from the point of view of non-Africans. This reinforces the idea that African women are often not the creators of their own narratives.  For good representation to occur, the marginalized people must be given control of their stories that are only theirs to be told. </p>
<p>More recently, the internet has become more volatile due to the increased rates of online gender-based violence. The internet has provided a new space in which women are targeted. This destroyed safe spaces for marginalized groups of people such as the LGBTQIA+ community and women. With the internet become a more discriminatory space, how do we expect to voice the concerns of these historically marginalized groups? Unfortunately, internet crimes does not hold any legal weight in many African countries. This raises the need for better legal regulation of internet practice. One indication of a step forward in this area has been South Africa’s recent criminalization of revenge porn. </p>
<p>We can see the need for the inclusion of African voices on the internet. The inclusion of African women on the internet allows for better representation of the continent. The inclusion of the continent into the global communication space is dependant on changing the biased and removed views of Africa. This can only be achieved by giving African creators a platform to share their experiences. To end this post, I will leave you with a quote by Magenya that sums up the immense need for a more feminist internet – <q> African feminists make more room for African women online.</q> </p>
