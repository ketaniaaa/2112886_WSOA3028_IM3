    <p>Software has very real implications in the real world. Today, we depend on technology for many crucial aspects of our lives, and our health is no exception. A recent tweet regarding a doctor struggling to understand how to recalibrate a ventilator perfectly illustrates the need to morally just coding practice. The internet is a vital media space and therefore creators need to be held responsible to the content that they create. Now the code we see in recreational spaces have extended to our health care systems. </p>
<p>Software is often coded for the medical field and the code that is written has a heavy impact. This demonstrates the need to standardize ethical coding practices. The creators behind the code that is used in medical equipment are far removed from the real-life impact of inconsiderate scripting choices. The fact that these developers have a direct impact on life and death should be highlighted throughout the production process. </p>
<p>Developers and the average person speak different languages. Literally. Tech geeks might understand arrays are variables, but the chances of the average user understanding code is low. This means that the code written to create content must be made accessible. <p>
<p>Medical software requires it to be reliable and usable. Reliability is crucial for emergency situations and the lifetime of the piece of equipment. This means that when the code is created for medical software, one must aim to create lasting software that is flexible to future improvements to technology. Developers should also aim to make their code as usable as possible. This can refer to the use of semantics, clear structures and importantly, clear user interface and experience design. </p>
<p>The bridge between the creators of the content and its users must be built. Research is a fundamental aspect to creating more ethical code. Understanding one’s users and how said users interact and understand the technology that they engage with should guide developers and designers.</p>
<p> One solution to making code, specifically meant for the medical industry is to create open-source code. According to <cite> Yackel (2001) </cite>, creating open-source code for medical equipment is not only cost-saving, but makes the technology that powers life-saving machinery accessible to its users. Standardizing medical software to become open source would allow for standardized practice. This therefore allows for software to become future-proofed as software is improved on communally and iteratively from a variety of creators.  </p>
<p>This also raises the question of market morality. It can be said that developers might stray from open-source medical software due to the decrease economic benefit for tech companies. I personally believe if you are tasked with creating equipment that is life-changing, the moral impact of the manner you create the product must be at the forefront of the production process. </p>
<p>I find myself left with more questions at the end of this post. Yes, morals and ethics are crucial to consider as a developer or designer, but will we ever be able to create better ethical code if we cannot get past the capitalist value of immoral tech practices? Keep an eye out for more thoughts about that.. <p>
