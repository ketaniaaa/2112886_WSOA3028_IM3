                     <h1> Design Guide</h1>
                     <h2 id="subhead">Aura Trend</h2>
                     <img src="../images/auracol.jpg" alt="A collage of radial gradients with bold texts and geometric shapes" id="auras">
                     <p>Ive noticed a trend online that uses radial gradients to describe auras. They are used often as poster design and 
                         are now seeing a web design trend. Given Cora's personality and status as a medium, I thought that she would be inclined to 
                         like this design trend. I have implemented radial gradients into the design on the website. Although this trend usually consists
                         of many pastel tones, I stuck to the same shade of orange that I have used througout the site for uniformity. I also noticed that
                         these images of auras usually include outlined shapes of stars, moons and orbs and bold oversized text. I have implemented this into my 
                         site as I made decorative images to be placed amongst the character content to reflect this trend. 
                     </p>
                     <p>This trend's use of shape also reflects Cora's personality as the use of stars and moons allude to esoteric symbolism. The use of these symbols 
                         correlates directly to Cora and helps with the visual understanding of the site so that users are aware they are browsing through a spiritual 
                         website. 
                     </p>
                     <h2 id="subhead">Brutalism</h2>
                     <p>
                       <img src="../images/brutalistcol.jpg" alt="A collage of websites and print design illustrating the Brutalist Movement" id="brut">
                     The main inspiration for the layout of my website was Brutalism. I spent a lot of time on 
                     <a href="https://www.behance.com" target="_blank" id="designlink"> Behance</a> for inspiration. Often times, layouts with alot of white space and solid borders caught my attention.
                     I did more research about the design movement and thought it aligned with Cora. The minimalist of this design movement allowed for the implementation of 
                     the esoteric elements without overloading the user. Brutalism makes use of strong structural elements, like the architeture movement of the same name. 
                     I have done this by including thick borders. The architectural style also makes use of line to create harsh shadows. I used this as inspiration
                     in my web design by making hard box borders a feature design element. Brutalism also tends to prefer muted and minimal color schemes. My website 
                     mainly deploys only three colors and images are often filtered to be greyscaled in order to fit a minimal look. The architeture style also emphasizes
                     the concrete of buildings. I adapted this by implementing a transparent textured background. I used an image of stars instead of concrete due to 
                     Cora's personality.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                         I also chose Brutalism because of its use of white space. White space in web design allows for users to avoid being overwhelmed by visual elements.
                         This seemed like it would be a goal of Cora's. As a spiritualist, she works with creating peace within her clients and therefore would want a clam
                         online space for her users to explore.
                     </p>
                    <h2 id="subhead">Colour Scheme</h2>
                    <img src="../images/scheme.png" alt="image showing the colors EB7350, black and white" id="colscheme">
                    <section>
                      <p>I have chosen a minimal colour palette in order to communicate a minimal design. I liked the idea of a black and white website with a 
                        pop of colour. When approaching the research for my site, I came across swiss web design. I noticed that a lot of jewel toned colors 
                        are used alongside otherwise monochrome schemes. I chose this orange because it has been featured in swiss design but also because the pairing
                        of orange and black tends to remind people of halloween. This connatation of the color scheme was aligned with Cora's image as a person and her interests.

                      <h2 id="subhead">Font</h2>
                      I have chosen to use Space Mono and Work Sans because they are minimal. Space Mono, I noticed, was often used in print design
                      that made use of oversized text. I liked the contrast of the harsh font that looks like an early web font against the more trendy minimalism 
                      of the other elements of the cite. I used Work Sans for the main sections of the articles for easier readability. 
                      <h1 id="exampletext">Space Mono</h1>
                      <h2 id="exampletext">Space Mono</h2>
                      <h3 id="exampletext">Space Mono</h3>
                      <p id="exampletext">Space Mono</p>
                      <p id="exampletext">Hello, this is an example of Work Sans in a paragraph form because I have not used it in larger sizes</p>
                      <h2 id="subhead">Logo</h2>
                        <p>As cora is a technomancer, I took this into consideration when creating the logo for the site. I made this made the logo in Illustator myself. 
                        The logo consists of a globe that has a mesh on it to relicate the www logo to indicate the internet. This globe is placed on a based to look like a crystal ball in order
                        to communicate that the character is a witch and that users entering the site are entering an esoteric site. This is further supported by the inclusion of 
                        other esoteric symbolism such as stars. I made variations of the logo for both the title icon and the header. I knew I wanted my header to consist of 
                        black copy and therefore in order to logo to appear coherent with the navigation. The title icon was made white and thicker for visability. The icon is used in 
                        order to allow the user to know what site each tab in their brower indicates. </p>

                        <h2 id="subhead">
Responsivity 
                        </h2>
                        <section>
                        <p>
                          The design choiced I made for the site to be responsive and accessibile mainly pertain to the navigation of the site. 
                          In order to create a more responsive site, I ensure that there was a collapsable menu. I indicated the presences of an expandable menu by using a hamburger
                          menu when the screen size is changed. </p>
                         <p> I made sure the Colour
                          palette is simple and high contrast. The use of high contrast is known to be more accessible to visually impaired users. This is prefered to color
                          palette with little variation as contrasting colors are easier to differentiate. 
                          In regards to my visual cues, I ensured that my navigational links had a hover effect in order to communicate an interactive aspect of the site
                          to the user. I did this by changeing the background colors on my header navigation and creating coloured outlines in my footer links. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I also made most of my sizing decisons based on responsivity. For most of my boxes, when looking at my CSS, i have used 1em padding and borders
                          in order to keep my formats uniform. I wanted my content to also make use of white space within the boxes they are situated. Sizing of images and 
                          widths are controlled using percentages instead of fixed units. The only instance of using pixels was in regard to my border decorations.
                        </p>
