<p>Last week, we had a look at the information geography. This week we will discuss the effects of information geography in regard to the digital divide. The digital divide refers to the gap between accessibility to digital devices <p>
    <p>I want to discuss the impact of the digital divide on South African society. As discussed last week, the global south is largely underdeveloped and therefore less accessible to becoming geographical knowledge sources. The UN has declared that sub-Saharan Africa is the worlds least developed area. This leads to a digital exclusion. This digital exclusion can be attributed to the lack of funds that would allow for more interaction with information sources. The economic situation of Africa has lead to an exclusion due to <qt author=" Fuchs and Horvak">unequal geography</qt>. While developed countries often prioritize other needs being satisfied, the increasing commonality of digital devices in daily life creates an impact on those affected by the digital divide. Technology can be used as a means to satisfy other needs and the digital divide makes this difficult.<p>
    <p> In attempts to alleviate this divide, South Africa was one of the few African countries that has opened our digital infrastructure to foreign investment. This was done to invite investors from information central areas of the world to include African countries in more digital spaces. This foreign investment was one of the many attempts to bridge the digital divide. Most of these attempts tend to focus on alleviating the material lack of access to digital spaces but this is not the only contributor to the digital divide. Van Djik and Hacker, <cite> 2003</cite> attribute the digital divide to a lack of access in four forms. These being mental access, material access, skill access and meaningful usage access. The access to hardware is decreasing due to the development of more lost cost and mobile technology but Africa is predicated to see an increase in usability skills that are required to make use of hardware. <p>
    <p>The impact of the digital divide only further alienates those affected from globalization. The lack of digital presence removes the identity of African from global communication. This intensifies the already existing inequality of information geography. The financial consequences to an already under-developed continent are dire and therefore gapping the digital divide must be prioritized. This can refer to skilling populations to be able to make use of their technology and creating environments in which users are allowed to use digital spaces in useful manners. Educating people on the impact of the digital divide is equally important as providing technical education. </p>
    <p>Although there is a shift to focus on the education of skills, the covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated the digital divide’s effect on lively hood <cite>(Adams and Ramsettey, 2020)</cite>. The pandemic has forced the transition to remote work and learning for safety. This safety can only be achieved if people are able to work and learn remotely. This is highlighted in the newest lockdown, which has seen immense spikes in the number of infections, particularly in Johannesburg. This has caused calls for schools to be shut down. The ramifications of a lack of digital access means that many learners would be forced to be deprived of their education. The digital divide in South Africa and globally in a time of distance interaction is only highlighted to urge the bridging of this gap.  </p>
