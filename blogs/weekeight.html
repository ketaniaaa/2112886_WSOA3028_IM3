<p><cite>Graham, de Sabbata and Zook (2015)</cite>aim to illustrate the influence of geography on the manner information is experienced and accessed in their article â€˜Towards a study of Information Geographiesâ€™. The article begins by illustrating the physical origin on information. All content has a geographical point of inception, and this location has ramifications on the content that is produced and shared. While information has become more mobile to the technological advances, the geography regarding the source of information is vital. </p>
<p>Prior to technological advances, information was mainly available to those in socio-political environments that allowed access to information. This was due to the lack of ability to easily distribute information and the laborious creation methods. The innovation of technology has aimed to change. The term â€˜death to distanceâ€™ has arose and the internet seeks to bridge users past physical limitations. Prior to modern technology, information had been politically and economically influenced. The rise of online spaces has suggested a shift to a more centralized information hub that is not imbedded with the ideology of the contentâ€™s original creation. It can be noted that the internet wishes to move past the previous impacts of geographical inequality on information, but I believe it will not be possible to separate geography from digital information any time soon. </p>
<p>Historic geographic information still effectâ€™s locations today. Due to colonisation, the global north has long remained the centre of power. One must acknowledge that power directly influences ones experience of information. The power that is concentrated in the global north has allowed for greater access to information. North America and Europe accounts for most of the worldâ€™s information creation, while the global South makes dismal contributions to the network of information. The global south is known to be less financially well off with most of the global south being developing countries who have experienced the impacts of colonization and exclusion from world power.  This demonstrates a direct link between both geographical location and information, but the influence on power in order to access information. The article visually illustrates the concentration of content that is released by location. It is clear the USA and much of Europe create more content than any other geographical locations. It must be noted that Africa drastically pales in comparison with regard to the amount of information that our continent generates. There is seen to be no link between population and content creation. Densely populated countries such as China, Russia and India contribute to information creation are a far lower rate than developed countries. This illustrates the impact of economics on the access to information.</p>
<p><cite>Graham, de Sabatta and Zook <cite> propose the idea of three distinct factors that influence to dispersion of information. These are the geographies of access and enablement, participation and representation. Access and enablement refers to the areas of populations that are exposed to the resources required to both create and experience information. It can be seen that again the global North possess the most internet permeation. This can be attributed to cost. Countries with struggling economies are not able to deploy not only the hardware necessary to access the information, but also the networking structure on a large scale. We see a trend on higher broadband prices in developing countries. This demonstrates the impact of geography on accessibility to information. Participation refers to the input of content based on geography. As previously mention, the contribution of the global south occurs at a far lower rates than North America and Europe. The lack of accessibility that these countries has a direct impact on the amount of participation. Without access to information, how is one able to participate. The lack of participation thus leads us to the last factor of information geography â€“ representation. With a lack of contribution to global information, large communities are under represented in media and information. This can be seen in the content that is largely consumed by South Africans. We are exposed to globally North produced content than we are to local content. The exclusion of populations for the network of information heightens the inequality as their voices are not able to be projected. </p>
<p>Another step towards better representation of information from the global south is the importance of education. I believe it is important to understand that the content generated from Africa is vital due to the underrepresentation of the continent. The contribution of indigenous information will allow a better global understanding of the continent. This can be seen as an initial push towards the continent being better included in the global information network. </p>
<p> Despite these suggestions to equalize the creation of information, we must acknowledge that this is a complex historic issue. I think that the authors make good points due there is no quick fix to the issue of geographical information. We are still experiencing the ramifications of the global power held by states centuries ago. It would be naÃ¯ve to think that the internet can alleviate these pre-existing issues. The issue of information geography cannot be approached from a binary point of view. A large contributor to the contribution of information is economic stability. The global south is accounts for only small fraction of money generated globally. In order to approach fixing the inequality regarding information concentration, we need the understand the intricacies of geographical economics. The ramifications of both economic and information geography will be further discussed next week when we unpack the digital divide. Look forward to the next time ðŸ˜‰ </p>
